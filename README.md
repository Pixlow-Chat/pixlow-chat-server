# pixlow-chat-server

PixlowChat is a online chat service. The frontend is saved to [pixlow-chat](https://github.com/Pixlow-Chat/pixlow-chat), where you can find more information about the project.

The backend (this repo) is built on a **Node.js server** using **Express**, and it integrates [**Socket.IO**](https://socket.io/), to handle realtime, bidirectional communication on the app.
